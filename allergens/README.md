# Allergen

Scientists have developed an allergy test that produces a single numeric score that summarizes information about all the allergies a person has.

The test checks for the following allergies and assigns them the corresponding value:

  * eggs (1)
  * peanuts (2)
  * shellfish (4)
  * strawberries (8)
  * tomatoes (16)
  * chocolate (32)
  * pollen (64)
  * cats (128)

If Jorge is allergic to peanuts and chocolate, he gets a score of 34.

Youâ€™re job is to write a program that takes the number and translates it back the allergens that the patient is allergic to.

In this case, 34 would translate back into a report saying that Jorge was allergic to peanuts and chocolate.

Because you all love TDD, here are some cases that you can test against:

  * A score of two would mean that the patient is allergic to just peanuts.
  * A score of 3 would mean that the patient is allergic to eggs and peanuts.
